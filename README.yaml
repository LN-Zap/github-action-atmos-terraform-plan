introduction: |-
  This Github Action is used to run Terraform plan for a single, Atmos-supported component and save the given planfile to S3 and DynamoDB.

  After running this action, apply Terraform with the companion action, [github-action-atmos-terraform-apply](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-apply)

usage: |-
  ### Prerequisites

  This GitHub Action requires AWS access for two different purposes. This action will attempt to first run `terraform plan` against a given component and 
  then will use another role to save that given Terraform Plan to an S3 Bucket with metadata in a DynamoDB table. We recommend configuring 
  [OpenID Connect with AWS](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services) 
  to allow GitHub to assume roles in AWS, and then deploying both a Terraform Plan role and a Terraform State role. 
  For Cloud Posse documentation on setting up GitHub OIDC, see our [`github-oidc-provider` component](https://docs.cloudposse.com/components/library/aws/github-oidc-provider/).

  In order to store Terraform State, we configure an S3 Bucket to store plan files and a DynamoDB table to track plan metadata. Both will need to be deployed before running
  this action. For more on setting up those components, see the `gitops` component (__documentation pending__). This action will then use the [github-action-terraform-plan-storage](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-terraform-plan-storage) action to update these resources.
