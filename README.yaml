  This is GitHub Action that can be used as a workflow for automatic updates via Pull Requests in your infrastructure repository according to versions in components sources.

usage: |-
  ### Prerequisites

  This GitHub Action requires AWS access for two different purposes. This action will attempt to first run `terraform plan` against a given component and 
  then will use another role to save that given Terraform Plan to an S3 Bucket with metadata in a DynamoDB table. We recommend configuring 
  [OpenID Connect with AWS](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services) 
  to allow GitHub to assume roles in AWS, and then deploying both a Terraform Plan role and a Terraform State role. 
  For Cloud Posse documentation on setting up GitHub OIDC, see our [`github-oidc-provider` component](https://docs.cloudposse.com/components/library/aws/github-oidc-provider/).

  In order to store Terraform State, we configure an S3 Bucket to store plan files and a DynamoDB table to track plan metadata. Both will need to be deployed before running
  this action. For more on setting up those components, see the `gitops` component (__documentation pending__). This action will then use the [github-action-terraform-plan-storage](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-terraform-plan-storage) action to update these resources.

  ### Workflow example

  ```yaml
    name: "atmos-terraform-plan"

    on:
      workflow_dispatch: {}
      pull_request:
        types:
          - opened
          - synchronize
          - reopened
        branches:
          - main

    # These permissions are required for GitHub to assume roles in AWS
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read

    jobs:
      plan:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Plan Atmos Component
            uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan@v1
            with:
              component: "foobar"
              stack: "plat-ue2-sandbox"
              terraform-plan-role: "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/acme-core-gbl-identity-gitops"
              terraform-state-bucket: "acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops"
              terraform-state-role: "arn:aws:iam::999999999999:role/acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops-gha"
              terraform-state-table: "acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops"
